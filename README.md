# MLOps Learning Project

- Goal: Build ML models and deploy them while learning MLOps principles.
- Skills: Python, scikit-learn, FastAPI, MLOps, AI ethics.
## üìù Setup Progress ‚Äì Week 1 (Sunday)

### Environment Setup
- [x] Created project folder: `~/mlops-learning`
- [x] Set up Python virtual environment: `venv`
- [x] Activated venv and verified Python version (`python3 --version`)
- [x] Upgraded pip inside venv and installed packages:
  - `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`

## Day 1 - Project Initialization
- [x] Created `README.md` with project goals and plan
- [x] Initialized Git repository and made first commit
- [x] Connected local repo to GitHub and successfully pushed
- [x] Repo visible in browser: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Cnguyen823/mlops-learning)

## Day 2 ‚Äì First ML Model

- [x] Implemented Logistic Regression on the Iris dataset.
- [x] Split data into train/test (80/20).
- [x] Achieved accuracy: ~97%.
- [x] Learned how to train, predict, and evaluate a simple classification model. See iris_model.py.

## Day 3 ‚Äì Cross-Validation & Reliable Model Evaluation

- [x] Understand why single train/test splits can be misleading.
- [x] Learn about k-fold cross-validation and LOOCV.
- [x] Implement cross-validation on the Iris dataset. See iris_crossval.py.

## Day 4 ‚Äì KNN, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest Comparison

- [x] Reviewed Day 3 concepts and code
- [x] Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
- [x] Implemented Logistic Regression:
- [x] Implemented Random Forest (optional/comparison):
- [x] Compared models using cross-validation:
- [x] Calculated accuracy, precision, recall, or RMSE
- [x] Decided which model works best for the dataset. See iris_model_comparison.py
