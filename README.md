# MLOps Learning Project

- Goal: Build ML models and deploy them while learning MLOps principles.
- Skills: Python, scikit-learn, FastAPI, MLOps, AI ethics.
## üìù Setup Progress ‚Äì Week 1 (Sunday)

### Environment Setup
- [x] Created project folder: `~/mlops-learning`
- [x] Set up Python virtual environment: `venv`
- [x] Activated venv and verified Python version (`python3 --version`)
- [x] Upgraded pip inside venv and installed packages:
  - `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`

### Project Initialization
- [x] Created `README.md` with project goals and plan
- [x] Initialized Git repository and made first commit
- [x] Connected local repo to GitHub and successfully pushed
- [x] Repo visible in browser: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Cnguyen823/mlops-learning)

### Next Steps (Monday)
- [ ] Start ML refresher: train a simple Logistic Regression model
- [ ] Practice loading datasets, preprocessing, and basic training
- [ ] Document workflow in GitHub repo

### Notes / Reflections
- Virtual environments keep projects isolated and reproducible
- Git + GitHub workflow established for version control
- Ready to start hands-on ML and MLOps practice tomorrow
